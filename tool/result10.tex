\color[rgb]{0.29411764705882354,0.3686274509803922,0.5058823529411764}A 16-year-old student at a private Baptist school who allegedly killed one teacher and wounded another before firing into a filled classroom apparently ``just snapped, the schools pastor said. ``I dont know how it could have happened, said George Sweet, pastor of Atlantic Shores Baptist Church. ``This is a good, Christian school. We pride ourselves on discipline. Our kids are good kids. The Atlantic Shores Christian School sophomore was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder, malicious assault and related felony charges for the Friday morning shooting. Police would not release the boys name because he is a juvenile, but neighbors and relatives identified him as Nicholas Elliott. Police said the student was tackled by a teacher and other students when his semiautomatic pistol jammed as he fired on the classroom as the students cowered on the floor crying ``Jesus save us! God save us! Friends and family said the boy apparently was troubled by his grandmothers death and the divorce of his parents and had been tormented by classmates. Nicholas grandfather, Clarence Elliott Sr., said Saturday that the boys parents separated about four years ago and his maternal grandmother, Channey Williams, died last year after a long illness. The grandfather also said his grandson was fascinated with guns. ``The boy was always talking about guns, he said. ``He knew a lot about them. He knew all the names of them  none of those little guns like a .32 or a .22 or nothing like that. He liked the big ones. The slain teacher was identified as Karen H. Farley, 40. The wounded teacher, 37-year-old Sam Marino, was in serious condition Saturday with gunshot wounds in the shoulder. Police said the boy also shot at a third teacher, Susan Allen, 31, as she fled from the room where Marino was shot. He then shot Marino again before running to a third classroom where a Bible class was meeting. The youngster shot the glass out of a locked door before opening fire, police spokesman Lewis Thurston said. When the youths pistol jammed, he was tackled by teacher Maurice Matteson, 24, and other students, Thurston said. ``Once you see what went on in there, its a miracle that we didnt have more people killed, Police Chief Charles R. Wall said. Police didnt have a motive, Detective Tom Zucaro said, but believe the boys primary target was not a teacher but a classmate. Officers found what appeared to be three Molotov cocktails in the boys locker and confiscated the gun and several spent shell casings. Fourteen rounds were fired before the gun jammed, Thurston said. The gun, which the boy carried to school in his knapsack, was purchased by an adult at the youngsters request, Thurston said, adding that authorities have interviewed the adult, whose name is being withheld pending an investigation by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The shootings occurred in a complex of four portable classrooms for junior and senior high school students outside the main building of the 4-year-old school. The school has 500 students in kindergarten through 12th grade. Police said they were trying to reconstruct the sequence of events and had not resolved who was shot first. The body of Ms. Farley was found about an hour after the shootings behind a classroom door.

But then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres said the offer from Bruce Rappaport, a partner in the San Francisco-based construction and engineering company, was ``unimportant, the senior official told The Associated Press. Peres, now foreign minister, never discussed the offer with other government \color[rgb]{0.8666666666666667,0.11372549019607843,0.5411764705882353}ministers, said the \color[rgb]{0.9137254901960784,0.34509803921568627,0.1568627450980392}official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The comments marked the first time Israel has acknowledged any offer was made for assurances not to bomb the planned 1 billion pipeline, which was to have run near Israels border with Jordan. The pipeline was never built. In San Francisco, Tom Flynn, vice president for public relations for the Bechtel Group, said the company did not make any offer to Peres but that Rappaport, a Swiss financier, made it without Bechtels knowledge or consent. Another Bechtel spokesman, Al Donner, said Bechtel ``at no point in development of the pipeline project had anything to do with the handling of the \color[rgb]{0.9647058823529412,0.1568627450980392,0.9411764705882353}oil.

Asked about Bechtels disclaimers after they were made in San Francisco, the Israeli Foreign Ministry official said Peres believed Rappaport made the offer for the company. ``Rappaport came to Peres as a representative of Bechtel and said he was speaking on behalf of Bechtel, the official said. ``If he was not, he misrepresented himself. The Jerusalem Post on Wednesday quoted sources close to Peres as saying that according to Rappaport, Bechtel had said the \color[rgb]{0.9647058823529412,0.1568627450980392,0.9411764705882353}oil \color[rgb]{0.9137254901960784,0.34509803921568627,0.1568627450980392}sales would have to be conducted through a third party to keep the sales secret from \color[rgb]{0.8666666666666667,0.11372549019607843,0.5411764705882353}Iraq and \color[rgb]{0.9137254901960784,0.34509803921568627,0.1568627450980392}Jordan. The Foreign Ministry official said Peres did not take the offer seriously. ``This is a man who sees 10 people every day, he said. ``Thirty percent of them come with \color[rgb]{0.9372549019607843,0.48627450980392156,0.396078431372549}crazy \color[rgb]{0.9137254901960784,0.34509803921568627,0.1568627450980392}ideas. He just says, `Yes, yes. Well think about it. Thats how things work in Israel. The offer appeared to be the one mentioned in a September 1985 memo to Attorney General Edwin Meese III. The memo referred to an arrangement between Peres and Rappaport ``to the effect that Israel will receive somewhere between 65 million and 70 million a year for 10 years. The memo from Meese friend E. Robert Wallach, Rappaports attorney, also states, ``What was also indicated to me, and which would be denied everywhere, is that a portion of those funds will go directly to Labor, a reference to the political party Peres leads. The Wallach memo has become the focus of an investigation into whether Meese knew of a possibly improper payment. Peres has denied any wrongdoing and has denounced the memo as ``complete nonsense. The Israeli official said Rappaport, a native of Israel and a close friend of Peres, relayed the offer to Peres earlier in September. ``Peres thought the offer was unimportant. For him, the most important thing was to have an \color[rgb]{0.8666666666666667,0.11372549019607843,0.5411764705882353}Iraqi oil \color[rgb]{0.9137254901960784,0.34509803921568627,0.1568627450980392}port near Israels border, the official said. ``The thinking was that this would put \color[rgb]{0.8666666666666667,0.11372549019607843,0.5411764705882353}Iraq in a \color[rgb]{0.9137254901960784,0.34509803921568627,0.1568627450980392}position where it would not be able to wage war with Israel, out of concern for its pipeline. A person answering the telephone at Rappaports Swiss residence said he was out of town and could not be reached for comment.

Mrs. Bloomberg, who has worked at the museum 10 years, was closing the office when the man appeared, saying he wanted to deliver a \color[rgb]{0.40784313725490196,0.20784313725490197,0.03529411764705882}plant, \color[rgb]{0.29411764705882354,0.3686274509803922,0.5058823529411764}Mrs. Liberace said. The man produced a gun, forced his way inside and refused offers of money, Mrs. Bloomberg said. ``Margaret offered him the days receipts, even offered him the money in her purse, but he wasnt interested, Mrs. Liberace said. ``He said `I dont want the cash. I want the jewelry. He obviously had been in there before and checked out the place. He seemed to know where everything was. Mrs. Bloomberg was able to warn a cleaning woman, who slipped out a back door and called police.

I told him Id get him out the back door. When we tried that, police were there, too. The gunman walked out the front door with a gun pointed at the bound hostage. ``He told police he would shoot me if they didnt let him get to his car, she recalled. ``I just tried to stay cool. ``She just sat down on the sidewalk, pretending her legs had collapsed under her, Mrs. Liberace said. ``He tried to lift her in the car but couldnt.

People around the world send their Valentines through the Loveland post office each year to get the special postmark and cachet verse. Ted Thompson, 85, has been coming up with verses since he and his wife, Mabel, started the remailing program in 1947. An estimated 300,000 people will get Thompsons latest Valentines verse: ``It might just be a song bird, ``Or perhaps some sparkling dew, ``That brings fond recollections, ``And a timeless cupid too. Thompson said recently hes not sure where he got the inspiration. ``It takes the whole year for me to get something Im satisfied with. Its a hard thing for me. Some people are born to write a verse for you, but thats far away from me. Since it stamped 300 pieces of mail its first year, more than 7 million Valentines have passed through the program. The mail is hand-stamped by about 50 senior-citizen volunteers. Theres no charge for the extra touch, which begins Monday and continues through Feb. 14.
