\color[rgb]{0.9921568627450981,0.6549019607843137,0.5882352941176471}A 16-year-old student at a private Baptist school who allegedly killed one teacher and wounded another before firing into a filled classroom apparently ``just snapped, the \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.2784313725490196,0.35294117647058826}schools \color[rgb]{0.9921568627450981,0.6549019607843137,0.5882352941176471}pastor said. ``I dont know how it could have happened, said George Sweet, pastor of Atlantic Shores Baptist Church. ``This is a good, Christian school. We pride ourselves on discipline. Our kids are good kids. The Atlantic Shores Christian School sophomore was arrested and charged with first-degree murder, attempted murder, malicious assault and related felony charges for the Friday morning shooting. Police would not release the boys name because he is a juvenile, but neighbors and relatives identified him as Nicholas Elliott. Police said the student was tackled by a teacher and other \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.2784313725490196,0.35294117647058826}students when his semiautomatic \color[rgb]{0.9921568627450981,0.6549019607843137,0.5882352941176471}pistol jammed as he fired on the classroom as the \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.2784313725490196,0.35294117647058826}students cowered on the \color[rgb]{0.9921568627450981,0.6549019607843137,0.5882352941176471}floor crying ``Jesus save us! God save us! Friends and family said the boy apparently was troubled by his grandmothers death and the divorce of his parents and had been tormented by classmates. Nicholas grandfather, Clarence Elliott Sr., said Saturday that the boys parents separated about four years ago and his maternal grandmother, Channey Williams, died last year after a long illness. The grandfather also said his grandson was fascinated with guns. ``The boy was always talking about guns, he said. ``He knew a lot about them. He knew all the names of them  none of those little guns like a .32 or a .22 or nothing like that. He liked the big ones. The slain teacher was identified as Karen H. Farley, 40. The wounded teacher, 37-year-old Sam Marino, was in serious condition Saturday with gunshot wounds in the shoulder. Police said the boy also shot at a third teacher, Susan Allen, 31, as she fled from the room where Marino was shot. He then shot Marino again before running to a third classroom where a Bible class was meeting. The youngster shot the glass out of a locked door before opening fire, police spokesman Lewis Thurston said. When the youths pistol jammed, he was tackled by teacher Maurice Matteson, 24, and other \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.2784313725490196,0.35294117647058826}students, Thurston said. \color[rgb]{0.9921568627450981,0.6549019607843137,0.5882352941176471}``Once you see what went on in there, its a miracle that we didnt have more people killed, Police Chief Charles R. Wall said. Police didnt have a motive, Detective Tom Zucaro said, but believe the boys primary target was not a teacher but a classmate. Officers found what appeared to be three Molotov cocktails in the boys locker and confiscated the gun and several spent shell casings. Fourteen rounds were fired before the gun jammed, Thurston said. The gun, which the boy carried to school in his knapsack, was purchased by an adult at the youngsters request, Thurston said, adding that authorities have interviewed the adult, whose name is being withheld pending an investigation by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The shootings occurred in a complex of four portable classrooms for junior and senior high \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.2784313725490196,0.35294117647058826}school students \color[rgb]{0.9921568627450981,0.6549019607843137,0.5882352941176471}outside the main building of the 4-year-old \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.2784313725490196,0.35294117647058826}school. The school has 500 students in \color[rgb]{0.9921568627450981,0.6549019607843137,0.5882352941176471}kindergarten through 12th grade. Police said they were trying to reconstruct the sequence of events and had not resolved who was shot first. The body of Ms. Farley was found about an hour after the shootings behind a classroom door.

\color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.3764705882352941,0.9725490196078431}The Bechtel Group Inc. offered in 1985 to sell oil to \color[rgb]{0.7450980392156863,0.5411764705882353,0.4235294117647059}Israel at a \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.3764705882352941,0.9725490196078431}discount of at least 650 million for 10 years if it promised not to bomb a proposed Iraqi pipeline, a Foreign Ministry official said Wednesday. But then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres said the offer from Bruce Rappaport, a partner in the San Francisco-based construction and engineering company, was ``unimportant, the senior official told The Associated Press. Peres, now foreign minister, never discussed the offer with other government \color[rgb]{0.7450980392156863,0.5411764705882353,0.4235294117647059}ministers, said the \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.3764705882352941,0.9725490196078431}official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The comments marked the first time \color[rgb]{0.7450980392156863,0.5411764705882353,0.4235294117647059}Israel has \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.3764705882352941,0.9725490196078431}acknowledged any offer was made for assurances not to bomb the planned 1 billion pipeline, which was to have run near Israels border with Jordan. The pipeline was never built. In San Francisco, Tom Flynn, vice president for public relations for the Bechtel Group, said the company did not make any offer to Peres but that Rappaport, a Swiss financier, made it without Bechtels knowledge or consent. Another Bechtel spokesman, Al Donner, said Bechtel ``at no point in development of the pipeline project had anything to do with the handling of the oil. He said proposals submitted by the company ``did not include any specific arrangements for the handling of the oil or for the disposal of the oil once it reached the terminal. Asked about Bechtels disclaimers after they were made in San Francisco, the \color[rgb]{0.7450980392156863,0.5411764705882353,0.4235294117647059}Israeli Foreign \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.3764705882352941,0.9725490196078431}Ministry official said Peres believed Rappaport made the offer for the company. ``Rappaport came to Peres as a representative of Bechtel and said he was speaking on behalf of Bechtel, the official said. ``If he was not, he misrepresented himself.

The Foreign Ministry official said Peres did not take the offer seriously. ``This is a man who sees 10 people every day, he said. ``Thirty percent of them come with crazy ideas. He just says, `Yes, yes. Well think about it. Thats how things work in \color[rgb]{0.7450980392156863,0.5411764705882353,0.4235294117647059}Israel. The \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.3764705882352941,0.9725490196078431}offer appeared to be the one mentioned in a September 1985 memo to Attorney General Edwin Meese III. The memo referred to an arrangement between Peres and Rappaport ``to the effect that \color[rgb]{0.7450980392156863,0.5411764705882353,0.4235294117647059}Israel will \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.3764705882352941,0.9725490196078431}receive somewhere between 65 million and 70 million a year for 10 years. The memo from Meese friend E. Robert Wallach, Rappaports attorney, also \color[rgb]{0.7450980392156863,0.5411764705882353,0.4235294117647059}states, \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.3764705882352941,0.9725490196078431}``What was also indicated to me, and which would be denied everywhere, is that a portion of those funds will go directly to Labor, a reference to the political party Peres leads. The Wallach memo has become the focus of an investigation into whether Meese knew of a possibly improper payment. Peres has denied any wrongdoing and has denounced the memo as ``complete nonsense. The \color[rgb]{0.7450980392156863,0.5411764705882353,0.4235294117647059}Israeli \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.3764705882352941,0.9725490196078431}official said Rappaport, a native of \color[rgb]{0.7450980392156863,0.5411764705882353,0.4235294117647059}Israel and a \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.3764705882352941,0.9725490196078431}close friend of Peres, relayed the offer to Peres earlier in September. ``Peres thought the offer was unimportant. For him, the most important thing was to have an Iraqi oil port near Israels border, the official said. ``The thinking was that this would put \color[rgb]{0.48627450980392156,0.5411764705882353,0.12549019607843137}Iraq in a \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.3764705882352941,0.9725490196078431}position where it would not be able to wage \color[rgb]{0.7450980392156863,0.5411764705882353,0.4235294117647059}war with Israel, out of \color[rgb]{0.6431372549019608,0.3764705882352941,0.9725490196078431}concern for its pipeline. A person answering the telephone at Rappaports Swiss residence said he was out of town and could not be reached for comment.

Saying that economic sanctions applied so far ``have not yet created enough pressure to force the ouster of strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Powell said ``we are examining additional pressure that might be brought to bear. He briefed reporters not long after giving the vacationing President Reagan an update on the Panamanian problem. A senior administration official, disussing Panama on grounds he not be publicly identified, said the United States would encourage any move within the Panamanian Defense Forces to oust Noriega. ``He still is firmly in control, but not as in control as he was, perhaps, a month ago, and every effort we can take to foster that discontent in the PDF, I can assure you we are taking, he said. ``If the PDF, after examining the situation, think it would be useful to remove General Noriega, I think that would be a very sound decision for them to take, the official said. Powell acknowledged that some corporations operating in Panama have balked at having their tax payments placed in an escrow account because of a concern that it could hamper their operations. For this reason, he said, White House advisers and other administration officials are studying the implications of invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act  which would authorize the government to seize these payments. ``We have to be cautious before you invoke ... because it is a very powerful tool, and the staff back in Washington is examining the pros and cons of invoking the act, Powell said. ``And if it is a sensible thing to do, to continue to apply pressure on General Noriega, we will provide that for the president for his consideration. Powell refused to discuss any military options being weighed, except he indicated there would be no immediate dispatch of troops beyond the 1,300 deployed to the Central American country early this week. Powell, an Army lieutenant general, said he believes there now is ``a reasonable degree of security for Americans living in Panama and the U.S. installations there. Meanwhile, the administration was taking a dim view of Jesse Jacksons contacts with Noriega, despite Jacksons diplomatic coups in the past during visits to Cuba and Syria. Following Jacksons disclosure that he had sent a letter to Noriega two weeks ago asking him to resign, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said Monday that such communications could prolong Noriegas grip on power. ``The proliferation of channels is a tactic Noriega uses to buy time, Ms. Oakley said. ``We have available channels of communication with Noriega if and when they are needed. We think it would be best to continue to use these channels exclusively. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with Reagan in California, also criticized the Democratic presidential candidates involvement in Panama. ``We have a bipartisan coordinated plan for dealing with Noriega, he said. ``Thats why its important to Congress and the public, and we believe its been working. Jackson has dealt successfully in the past with other U.S. adversaries. In 1984, he traveled to Cuba and persuaded President Fidel Castro to release 26 political prisoners. He later went to Syria and, during talks with President Hafez Assad, won freedom for an American military pilot detained there. His efforts earned him an enthusiastic White House welcome. Jackson said he has no plans to travel to Panama to try to help resolve the 6-week-old crisis in that country. About 1,300 Army soldiers and Marines were headed to Panama today, joining the 10,000 troops stationed at the U.S. Southern Command in Panama. The Pentagon said the soldiers are being sent to increase security for Americans and U.S. facilities in Panama. In a related development, a former Panamanian official told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Monday that Noriega probably has evidence of complicity by U.S. officials in Central American drug trafficking. Jose I. Blandon produced a document Noriega sent to the countrys U.S. diplomatic offices in February saying he has proof that American officials knowingly established policies that supported people in the drug business. Blandon, a former intelligence official and consul general who defected last year, mentioned Panama, Guatemala and Costa Rica. Jackson says he agrees with the Reagan administration that Noriega should step down, but he has accused U.S. officials of overkill in trying to achieve that goal through economic sanctions that have contributed to economic paralysis in Panama. Jackson, appearing Monday in Milwaukee, renewed his call for Noriega to leave Panama and released a letter in which Noriega rejected ``any political and economic program that will be dictated from Washington, D.C. ``My duration as commander and chief of the defense forces is governed by the Panamanian constitution and law of the defense forces, Noriegas letter said. While releasing the letter, Jackson renewed his call for Noriega to go into exile. ``I remain convinced that it is in the best interests of the Panamanian people for General Noriega to leave, Jackson said. ``Today I reiterate my public moral appeal for him to depart.
